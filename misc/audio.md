 Welcome to the chaincode podcast. I'm here with merch. Hi there. Today we're gonna jump into the mampl and That's a pun feeling get it welcome to chaincode decoded the mampl The mampl an area you are more than familiar with a mampl whisper What's maybe start with what's the relationship between the mampl and fees? We often talk about the mampl, but there is no such thing as a global mampl every full known has its own mampl and The mampl is basically just the queue of transactions waiting to get confirmed Where confirmed means included in a block? So by default Block template builders will just sort the waiting transactions by the highest effective fee rate Then pick from the top the juicier at transaction the quicker it gets confirmed now Especially in the last few months. We've seen that there was a very large queues because we had a huge run-up in the price I haven't checked but I think it's now about 120 days that We haven't cleared the mampl maybe 110 and since 15th of December so mampls are limited and By default they are limited to 300 megabytes of Deciolized data so that includes all the overhead structure the previous u-tixos maybe even the whole transaction that created u-tixos and so forth so roughly at About 80 blocks worth of data the default of 300 megabyte gets exceeded and at that point a full node will automatically start Purging the lowest fee rate transactions. They just drop them until all their neighboring peers They don't send anything under this fee rate. They they start raising up their min fee rate so The problem that gets introduced here is if a parent transaction is no longer in the mampl You cannot bump it because if you try to do a CPFP and the parent isn't there The child is going to be invalid CPFP just for the initiated child pays for a parent job Some things that are being done in the context of that is that people are working on package Relay where you can send more than one transaction to fear as a package that they evaluate as a whole together Instead of looking at the parent and saying okay, you're out and this child doesn't have a parent Okay, you're out to And maybe you can just talk a little bit more about the mechanics of how CTFV actually works to get into a block you bid on block space transactions get serialized in in a format where Inputs are fairly big outputs are smaller There's a little bit of a transaction header that encodes like how many inputs there outputs there and Lockton inversion So we already found out that when miners build blocks they sort transactions by the highest fee rate So they first considered a transaction that paid the most set of tauches per byte of serialized data So what's the mechanic where the mechanics of CPFP? When you try to get a transaction through sometimes they have a Fre rate that is too low for it to be considered quickly and you can reprioritize your transaction By increasing its effective fee rate now you cannot edit a transaction after you submitted it to the network because the transaction itself is immutable But what you can do is you can spend one of the outputs of the transactions with a nether child transaction that has a very high fee and Now the child transaction can only be valid by the parent getting included in the block So miners will look at transaction packages actually they sort the weight list by their Ancestor fee rate of transactions not just by transactions in this singular So when you have a child that is super juicy It basically pays for the parent to get included at well as well So literally tell pays for parent got every parent's dream to have their children pay for You said that when miners evaluate these fee rates Is that built in the Bitcoin core are they writing custom software for that? Bitcoin core has a get black template call which allows you to exactly do that just generate a block template But I believe that most miners are probably running custom code because for example They accept out of band payments to reprioritize transactions or they run their own wallet service on this side and always Prioritize their own transactions or they might have some sort of other solver that optimizes block template building further So I think that I haven't looked at this in detail But I think that at least they're not running default values because by default Blocks created by Bitcoin core would leave a little space. I think about six kilobarts and Blocks are full if you look at them. So they must have at least tweaked it a little bit And we're not when we say miners we're talking about pools. Yes, right. So most miners as in the people running a6 or whatever They just join a pool who does the coordination of the work and they basically the pool operator picks the block template that is being worked on and the Minor just gets a separate workspace that they iterate over in order to try to find the This problem sounds hard. Why is it hard to estimate? Fear is so black discovery is a random process think of like Decay of radio active isotopes what we do there is we can give you a half time It usually takes around this much of time for half of the atoms to dissipate but We can't tell you if we look at a single atom when it's actually gonna Disipated might be immediately it might be at the half time it might take decades Right with blocks. That's the same thing there in average coming in at I think about 9.7 minutes but When the next block is gonna be found is up to this random press-on process Actually, it is such that since there is no memory to the process It's every draw to its has a chance to succeed at every point in time The next block is about 10 minutes away in average Yeah, it's really intuitive to think about that right if even if you're 18 minutes into not finding a block the next block will be found in 10 minutes Yes, exactly. You don't know when the next block is gonna be found So you don't know what transactions you will be competing against you might be competing against the transactions that are Tearncy in the mempool plus the transactions that get added in the next one minute You might be competing against the transactions in the mempool plus 10 minutes or plus 60 minutes Because about once a day there's a block that takes 60 minutes really you have this one shot to pick exactly the right Feed rate to slide in at the bottom of the block that you want to be in because if you don't slide in at the bottom of the block You're overpaying and if you underestimate You're not gonna get confirmed in the time that you were aiming to be confronted and so how do exchanges? Usually do this are they overpaying are they just estimating the the upper end? Maybe like who's paying those fees? Right, there's certain there's different scenarios some exchanges have different tiers like low-time preference and high-time preference or whatever and and they treat those differently but generally most exchanges by now batch there with draws Which gives them a way to leverage their scale? So if you're sending to 20 people every minute Making one transaction out of that is a lot cheaper than making 20 separate payments It's also much easier to manage your due-tixo pool that way and Then they just tend to very conservatively estimate their fees just Being the next to blocks and maybe rather overpaced lately because it's so much less work To deal with all the customer compliance over step transactions then To pay like sure we're overpaying by 30% to be in the next block Well, it's not them. That's overpaying. That's right. Usually that's get passed on to the customer There there's different models. I think in most actually the exchange pays but they take a flat fee for a withdrawal or really yeah, so like Bit stem for a very long time for example had like I think a 90 cent 90 Euro cent flat withdrawal fee, but then they bet every few minutes only You said that the number hasn't really been empty for almost four months Yeah, that's correct. Is the ever gonna empty again as we go to the moon does What happens to the month all yeah? That's a great question. I think we will eventually see a mempool empty again But there should probably be a long tail end to it emptying Because now in this for months a lot of the exchanges that usually would do consolidation to keep their UTxo pool size manageable they haven't been able to get any of those through so when the fee rates go down now I think that we all see more people put in their consolidation transactions at like three to five Satoshi's provide and That I think we we might not see an empty mempool for multiple months So even if the top fee rates get a lot more relaxed now Generally the competition to be in blocks seems to correlate with volatility under especially price rises When when the market heats up and and people are more excited to trade There's more transaction volume on the network And now we've seen in the past four weeks or so the price has been going more sideways There might have been even a small dip share in there and the top fee rates have come down the On the weekends it's dropped for a seven Satoshi per bite then six and now last weekend Six was cleared completely. I don't think that getting a one Satoshi per bite transaction through will be possible Anytime soon, but it'll be very possible to wait to the weekend to get a 10 Satoshi per bite transaction for maybe from like a more Met of you so the miners like this don't they like having high fees because One is revenue for them, but also As we sort of zoom out we think about the decreasing block reward over time Don't we have to have a high fee environment in order for this system to work under one hand You have to also consider that the exchange rate 10x in the last year So the same fee rates represent a 10x purchasing value in cost for Getting essentially the same service a transaction into a block So while the fee rates are similar the cost of getting a transaction through has actually increased Their miners do love it because I think fee rates make about 17% or so of the block reward right now So I'm not that I mean, but yeah, that's a nice little tip, right? But there is definitely a concern that when we continue to reduce the blocks of subsidy in every four year have an Rewards schedule that eventually the system will have to subside just transaction fees and if the transaction fees are too low it will basically not be Economic for miners to provide security to the Bitcoin system So there is a good argument for not increasing the blocks base To our degree where it's always going to be empty If you want to do that you essentially have to Also switch to an endless block subsidy Otherwise there is no economic incentive for miners to continue mining if there is Not enough fees unless unless your minimum fee rate at some point becomes so valuable that Even at minimum fee rate any transactions are Are some sort of sufficient revenue for miners to continue their business Maybe we can sort of circle back to what happens when transactions are Affected from the mumble and to talk about like what problems that could introduce especially for fee bumping and and lightning channel closing right when a Mempool fills up as we said earlier the node will start dropping the lowest fee rate transactions and especially for people or services that use Unconfirmed inputs that can be a problem at times because you cannot Spend an input that is unknown to other nodes So if all other nodes on a network have dropped the transaction Your follow-up transaction that spends the output from that drop transaction will not be able to relay on the network so You cannot only Not spend your funds, but you can also not Reprioritize the prior transaction one thing that that Soles basically is rbf Because you can just rewrite a replaceable transaction and submit a transaction with a higher fee rate So we went over a cpfp can we go over rbf? Sure. So dip 125 introduces Rules by which you are allowed to replace transactions You have to explicitly signal that a transaction is replaceable and In that case before a transaction is confirmed the sender may issue an updated version of the transaction Which can completely change the outputs The only restriction is that it has to use one of the same inputs Otherwise it wouldn't be a replacement and So it has to be a conflicting transaction essentially and Additionally, it has to pay enough fees To replace the prior transaction and all the transactions that change off of them In the mempool. So if you had like three transactions you have to pay More fees than the replacement than those three transactions together All right, so last double spending. Let's go over sign So I do not like to term double spending in that context So the problem with that is a successful double spend means That either you actually got two transactions that were in conflict confirmed Which could basically only happen if you have two competing blocks where one block had a prior version and the second block had another and then the second block eventually becomes part of the best chain Or when you at least convince somebody that they had been paid But then actually manage to spend defense somewhere else But here in this case are the F transactions Are explicitly labeling themselves as replaceable Basically they're running around with a red letter sign on front of their chest do not trust me And most wallet software just doesn't show you RB F transactions until they are confirmed Once confirmed in the blockchain they're exactly the same and same reliability as any other transaction But while Tuing they are explicitly saying look, I could be replaced do not consider yourself paid So calling this a double spend is really just saying that well Somebody made extremely unreasonable assumptions about the reliability of a transaction that explicitly warned them that it's not reliable So I like conflicting transactions more in this context and maybe why do we need two ways to bump fees Why do we need RBF and CpfB right so they have slightly different trade-offs Cpfp allows any recipient of a transaction to bump it right that could be a recipient in the sense that the person that got paid Or the sender if there was a change I put on the transaction It also doesn't change the TXID because you're just training other transactions on it and it It takes more blocks this right because you now have to send a second transaction in order to Increase the effective fee rate of the first so more blocks this Easier to keep track of and more flexibility as in there's more parties that can interact with it RBF on the other hand allows you to completely replace the transaction Which means that it is more flexible But you potentially have to pay more fees especially if somebody else trained off of your transaction already It changes the TXID and a lot of wallets and services have been tracking payments by the TXID Rather than looking at like what address got paid what their amount was or Whatever as in like treating Bitcoin addresses as invoices as they should be used they built a whole system around TXID so RBF transactions that They change the inputs or outputs right otherwise they couldn't change the fees And that means that they have a new TXID and it it is not trivial to keep proper track of that and to update your UX and UI to make that Easily accessible to your users, right? Then also only the sender can bump a transaction doing that because they have to reissue The updated very end of the transaction Given that it is a little more difficult to interact with RBF transactions a lot of services Only see them once they're confirmed once they're reliable So if you're trying to get a service To give you something very quickly You might want to choose to not do an RBF transaction in the first place so that they can Reasonably assume oh, this has a high enough fee rate and we know the user We can trust them that they're sending us to use three dollars actually and give them access to that song or whatever Okay, so we ask the question like what problems do does an uncomfortable eviction? Cause for fee bumping and and also maybe the lightning Channel closing use case we talked a bit generically about how parent transactions being gone Stops you from being able to spend those unconfirmed outputs But there's this especially a problem in the context of lightning because when you close a lightning channel It's either the collaborative case where you have no problem because you can renegotiate the closing transaction with your partner But where you really needed you're trying to unilaterally close because your partner has Channel partner hasn't shown up in all then you you have to fall back to the transaction that you had in the Negotiated sometime in the past when you last updated the commitment transaction So let's say that was in a low fee rate time and now the fee rates have exploded and you can't actually even Broadcast the commitment transaction to the network because it's too low fee rate Now the the problem is the party that is closing the lightning channel under the ln penalty update mechanism Their funds are actually locked with a CSV so they can't do CPFP because The output is only spendable after the transaction is confirmed for multiple blocks So you can't obtain a transaction to a output that is not spendable while it's still unconfirmed Especially for in lightning this introduces the While utility in the blocks based market introduces a headache because You can literally come into the situation where you can't close your lightning channel due to the fee rate So one approach I've heard about is to introduce anchor outputs Which are depending on the proposal either spendable by either side or spendable under certain conditions But they immediately spendable so they can be CPFP Or another idea is to have package relay, right? Because if the channel closing transaction Has a low fee rate and you can then relay it together with a second transaction That'll work except if you're unilaterally closing because the CSV issue still Pretends to that But either way if you get package relay You would be able to do away with the fee estimate and commitment transactions altogether because We talked about how fee estimation is hard for regular transactions fee estimation for commitment transactions is even much harder because you have no clue when You will want to use the transaction. Yeah, that dependency seems Very scary right you have absolutely no clue what the fee rates will be like when when you actually try to use it Having package relay would in combination with anchor outputs would allow you to always have a therapy on the commitment transaction and then basically always bring your own fee when you broadcast it in the CPFP child transaction Got it. Okay, so we sort of talked about some specifics But maybe we can zoom out and you know What are some ways that we could be using our box space more efficiently? What are some things that make us optimistic about the future? We still have only about I think 40% are so seguered inputs Now about 55% of all transactions use seguered inputs, but the majority of inputs is still non-seguered Once more people start using seguered or even taproot once taproot comes out The input sizes will be smaller or naturally there will be More space for more transactions So recently a major service wallet service provider Unhounds on first of April nonetheless that they would be switching to native seguered addresses And they they had been a long holdout so blockchain.com has probably around 33% of all transaction creations among their use of this Yeah, I mean that dependency is Worshacking our heads simultaneously Yeah Segment activated on 24th half obvious in 2017, right? That's three and a half years ago And until recently I think they weren't even able to send to native seguered address those And now they announced that not only They'll actually default to native seguered address was all together I think they claimed this month, but I'm hoping that they'll come through with that because We have a huge backlog of all these outputs that they created over the years It has been one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets for Yeah, almost a decade And it will take forever for all of these non-seguered outputs to eventually get spent But the observation is that most inputs are consuming just very young outputs So funds that got moved are much more likely to move again soon So Seeing that blockchain.com will hopefully switch to native seguered outputs soon I would assume that even while the UTX OSET will have a lot of non-seguered outputs living there for a very long time The transactions that get built will much quicker become seguered transactions to a high degree If 33% of all transactions, let's say 80% of them become seguered inputs and literally more than half their input sides That would be I want to say like 15% of the current blocks based the man going away overnight. Yeah Yeah, that would do the calculation more more thoroughly, but other other holdouts Bitmax recently switched to native seguered, I think for deposits There's still quite a few services that use wrapped seguered rather than native seguered Which already gets most of the efficiency, but clearly not all It was actually expecting that the high fee rates might get more people moving I think that the taproot rollout might get a huge blocks based efficiency gain because Taproot introduces a bunch of new features that are only available through taproot and taproot outputs and inputs are About the size of paid to a witness publicly hash in total So smaller than a lot of the multi-state constructions these days even in native seguered And definitely smaller than everything non seguered So any any wallets that switch to taproot will bring down the blocks based use a lot quickly Yeah, the multi-sakes savings are pretty significant. Yeah, and hopefully it'll bring in any era of Multi-sink being more standard. I think that's a more exciting thing It'll take quite some time because to do the public key aggregation that will bring the Biggest efficiency gain people will actually have to implement news take or another aggregation algorithm And until that gets into regular wallets will be a while I think maybe the first it gets into libraries and Especially for services with multi-state wallets There would be a huge efficiency gain there and they they should have great incentives to roll it out very quickly Thanks for listening to another episode of chaincode decoded and we're gonna keep it rolling We'll have another one next week. Yeah, let's talk about maybe how the blockchain works. Go back to basics
